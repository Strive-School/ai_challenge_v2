# Welcome

Dear Applicant,

Congrats on making it this far! At Strive School we believe in giving everyone an equal chance to succeed.And yet, it is entirely possible that you find some of the notebook exercises confusing or that you don't know how to code in a **Jupyter notebook or even Python**. Our goal is to **select individuals with high potential** to further empower your knowledge and likelihood of getting a job. Note that this doesn't mean high potential individuals who already know how to do the exercises. Our hopes here are that if you are motivated enough, you also go through the process of learning how to answer such questions even if you did not know python beforehand. We want to develop exceptional data scientists from unconventional places and backgrounds.

# What you need to know in order to complete the exercises

Here are the most fundamental resources that you will need to learn Python. Pick whatever style suits you best: 
- [Programming Language Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals-3/exploring-languages)
- [4 hour Python Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
- [6 hour complete Python Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
- [Python Kaggle Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

Here are the topics that you need to now in order to complete the challenge:
- Functions
- If / Elif / Else statements
- For and Nested loops
- Integers, Strings and Floats
- Lists and dictionaries
- Return statement
- Importing Files
- Iterating through files and text
- Tuples and mutability
- Nested
- How to debug in Python

and to launch and complete our Jupyter notebook if you have never seen this format before:
- A) You can download the file, and launch it directly on [Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agj3AxNPDWU).
- B) Installing Anaconda on [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart) | [Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) | [Windows](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows/)
- [Running a Jupyter notebook from Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
- C) Or, if you want to code in a .py file, [How to convert a Jupyter Notebook into a .py file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37797709/convert-json-ipython-notebook-ipynb-to-py-file)

**Difference between a Jupyter Notebook and Python**
While Python is a programming language that you may already be familiar with, Jupyter notebook provides us for a sequential way of executing cells (containing python code), which is quite useful for Machine Learning since it is normally a process that is very similar from one task to another and always done in the same order.
